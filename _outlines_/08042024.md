MILESTONE: input + output and we can compile + play

- Frontend
    - (DONE) Input node
        - (DONE) input title
        - (DONE) choose file
        - (DONE) display chosen file name
        - (DONE) node handle
            - (DW FOR NOW) if a node has multiple handles connected to different nodes, how does that show up in edges data?
    - (DONE) Output node
        - (DONE) node handle
    - (DONE) Basic buttons
        - (DONE) Compile button
            - sends command
        - (DONE) Play button
            - sends command
    - (DONE) Status bar
        - (DONE) (this event is called send_status_message) Displays messages from the backend 
            - this should probably just be a tauri event
        
- Backend
    - key constraint: FOR NOW no streaming, things are loaded into memory, things work on the full uncompressed samples
        - just go use Hound for WAV
        - yeah this is stupid but lets be easy on ourselves
    - (DONE) Graph types
        - (DONE) Type for edge data - number, sound, etc.
            - For now theres only one type of edge - sounds
        - (DONE) Unified graph structure
            - Petgraph looks like it can store all the data we need, so lets go with that
                - acc wait how does this work with our input setup
                    - We have an edge from X node to Y node. Edge maps the output index from X node to input index for Y node.
        - (DONE) Type for nodes
            - UPDATE: for now lets just do an enum and repeat ourselves a lil
            - All nodes have inputs + outputs, but diff nodes have diff internal data and implementations
                - Node just needs to store outputs, cause inputs come from other nodes outputs
                - Outputs for node is Vec<EdgeData>
                - Nodes have a struct that contain the outputs vec and then a Box<dyn NodeImpl>?
            - What is NodeImpl
                - has forward()
                    - how does its inputs get passed in?
                        - We know where its inputs come from for edges, petgraph has edges iterators which I think could work for this
                            - loop through each edge (X->Y), when Y == node in question, add the output from X to a vec, that vec gets passed to forward()
                        - forward then gets a Vec<EdgeData> which is all the inputs it needs (see above)
    - (DONE but **SEVERLY UNTESTED**) Graph processing
        - (DONE) Parsing incoming json
            - uhhh
        - (NAH SKIP) Validation step
            - Make sure if a node has inputs all those inputs are met
                - I think we can just do this when we're calling forward - avoid an upfront preprocessing step for now
        - (DONE) Processing step
            - Topological sort
                - Petgraph
            - Evaluating each node
                - just call forward from the sorted order
                - each node needs its inputs doe
    - Audio playback
        - Get the output node
            - We need to validate and make sure theres only one output node
        - Pass in finished buffer to audio process
            - Lots of existing code exists for this with old rita, so I think this is mostly copying stuff
            - For now just play the audio straight when done, we can figure out seeking and pausing later.
